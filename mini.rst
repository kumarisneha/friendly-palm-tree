My First Mini Project
=====================

Introduction
------------
Sometimes we need to extract some information from website but data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data,but if the data from the websites is changed then again i have to do the same work for changing and updating our data. This is a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction)will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.

Three .py files in mymodule folder

1. funproject2.py--> Extracting mp4 videos name from www.mobmp4.org
#. funproject3.py--> Extracting all the groceries from www.zopbazaar.com

All this three .py files are imported to main.py from mymodule folder.
